Hey. This is a game with a working title of Esoteric File Management Game. First, run 'ls' in your terminal to see what else is here. 
For any command given to you in this journey, omit the quotes: 'ls' => ls

If you come across a file ending with .sh, for example hello.sh, you can run it with './hello.sh'
Most files will also support a help flag, so you can run `./hello.sh --help` as well

If that doesn't work, you may need to run 'chmod +x hello.sh' to give it execute permissions and then try './hello.sh' again

If you get stuck during any commands, hitting escape and or ctrl c will get your terminal back. In some instances, q will be the way to exit something you have open.
