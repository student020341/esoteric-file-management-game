Welcome to the world of esoteric file management game. If you would like to read files entirely within the terminal instead of opening them in a text editor,
you can read the contents of files with commands. Here are a few

cat filename - print the contents of filename to the terminal
head filename - print the beginning few lines of filename to the terminal
tail filename - print the last few lines of filename to the terminal

less filename - for reading larger files, you can use less. This will give you an interactive window where you can use j,k,u,d to navigate up and down the file. 
    when you're done reading the file, press q to close less. If this doesn't close less, try hitting escape a few times and try q again.
    inside less, you can use / to search. To find 'hello' inside a file, you could type /hello. n and shift+n will jump between results of that search. 

for more information on these commands or any command, use the manual command 'man', for example 'man less'
    it has similar navigation to less, so use j,k,u,d to navigate, / to search, and q to close!
